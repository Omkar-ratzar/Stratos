ok so this is list of best text to speech or speech to text python codes in my directory

text to speech -->
NT2S.py
but the thing is, this generates a wav file which needs to be reconverted using
 ffmpeg -i "natural.wav" -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 44100 -ac 2 CONVERTED.wav

CONVERTED.wav is the one which is better to be used as it has better file inegrity

now, speech to text -->
S2T2.py. Feed this program CONVERTED.wav file heh!
